# Category animated icons (Lottie)

Place Flaticon Lottie JSON files here to enable **animated** icons on the category selection (welcome) and profile category preferences.

- File names must be: `{icon_id}.json` (e.g. `19033765.json`).
- Download the Lottie JSON from each Flaticon animated icon page (e.g. https://www.flaticon.com/free-animated-icon/woman-warrior_19033765) and save as the ID from the URL.

If no JSON is present, the category card will show the static PNG from Flaticon’s CDN.
